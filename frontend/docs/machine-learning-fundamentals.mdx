# 3. Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. In this chapter, we'll dive into the core concepts and fundamental types of machine learning, giving you a solid foundation for understanding how AI systems learn and make decisions.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the most common type of machine learning. It involves training a model on a labeled dataset, meaning the training data includes both the input and the correct output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs, and then this learned mapping can be used to predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.

### Key Concepts in Supervised Learning

*   **Classification:** Predicting a categorical label (e.g., spam or not spam, cat or dog).
*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous value (e.g., house prices, stock prices).
*   **Labeled Data:** Data where the "correct answer" is already known.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The goal is to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data without any prior knowledge of the output. This is often used for exploratory data analysis or as a preprocessing step for supervised learning.

### Key Concepts in Unsupervised Learning

*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).
*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information (e.g., PCA).
*   **Association:** Discovering rules that describe large portions of your data (e.g., market basket analysis).

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. It's about learning what to do—how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward signal.

### Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning

*   **Agent:** The learner or decision-maker.
*   **Environment:** The world the agent interacts with.
*   **State:** The current situation of the agent in the environment.
*   **Action:** A move made by the agent.
*   **Reward:** A feedback signal from the environment.
