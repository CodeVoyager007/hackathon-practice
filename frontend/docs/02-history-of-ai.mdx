# Chapter 2: The History of AI

The concept of artificial beings with intelligence has been a part of human storytelling for centuries, but the scientific journey of AI began in the mid-20th century. This chapter traces the key milestones that have led to the AI revolution we are witnessing today.

## The Birth of AI (1950s)

The 1950s marked the official birth of AI as a field of study. Several key events laid the groundwork for everything that was to come.

*   **The Turing Test (1950):** Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician and computer scientist, proposed a test to determine a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. The "Turing Test" remains a significant concept in the philosophy of AI.
*   **The Dartmouth Workshop (1956):** The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined at this legendary summer workshop at Dartmouth College. The event brought together the founding fathers of AI, including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Claude Shannon, who envisioned a future where machines could think.

## The First AI Winter and the Rise of Expert Systems (1970s-1980s)

After the initial excitement, progress in AI slowed down. The limitations of computer hardware and the complexity of the problems led to a period known as the "AI winter," where funding and interest in the field dwindled.

However, this era also saw the development of **expert systems**. These were the first truly successful forms of AI software. They were designed to emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific domain, such as medical diagnosis.

## Key Milestones: AI Gets Smarter

The 1990s and 2000s saw a resurgence of AI, fueled by faster computers and the availability of large datasets.

*   **Deep Blue vs. Garry Kasparov (1997):** In a landmark event, IBM's Deep Blue chess-playing computer defeated the reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. It was a powerful demonstration of how machines could solve complex problems with brute-force computation.
*   **The Rise of Machine Learning:** The internet boom created massive amounts of data, which became the fuel for **machine learning**. Instead of being explicitly programmed, systems could now learn from data. This became the dominant paradigm in AI development.

## The Deep Learning Revolution (2010s-Present)

The 2010s were defined by the rise of **deep learning**, a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep").

*   **ImageNet and AlexNet (2012):** The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) became a benchmark for computer vision. A deep neural network named AlexNet achieved a stunning victory, dramatically lowering the error rate for image recognition. This event kickstarted the deep learning revolution.
*   **AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol (2016):** Google DeepMind's AlphaGo program defeated Lee Sedol, the world champion Go player. This was a monumental achievement, as Go is a game of immense complexity and intuition, which many thought was beyond the reach of AI for at least another decade.

This historical journey shows that AI is a field built on decades of research, perseverance, and breakthrough moments. Each milestone has brought us closer to the intelligent systems we have today.
